## HOW TO USE JWT IN THE EXPRESS BACKEND SERVER

### 1. **Install the necessary packages:**
   You need to install the `jsonwebtoken` package to work with JWTs in your Express.js application.

   ```bash
   npm install jsonwebtoken
   ```

### 2. **Setup your Express app:**
   Set up your Express application and include the necessary middleware. For example:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
   const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;

   app.use(bodyParser.json());
  ```
